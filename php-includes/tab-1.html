An element of play is an important part of the design process, and an antidote to dry intellectualism. I hope an element of fun shows through in the final product and evokes an emotional response in those who encounter or live with my work.</p>  <blockquote id="comission"><p><span id= "comissionText">Work on commission:</span> I welcome enquiries, tentative or otherwise, and will reply promptly. I regularly deal with clients who are at some distance from me.</p> <p>I carry very little stock, but make items as commissioned or for exhibition. Some of my designs, for instance chairs, are produced in small runs, while other items are made singly. Yet other pieces are unique and cannot be reproduced exactly but may be recreated in essence.</p></blockquote> <p class="right" id="quoteName">- Chris Wilson</p>
